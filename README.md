**Abstract of the paper**

Maintenance of energetic homeostasis during periods of limited availability of food requires metabolic adaptation. Inherited disorders of mitochondrial metabolism, including isolated methylmalonic aciduria (MMAuria), present unique challenges to this homeostasis due to chronic loss of function of energetic pathways. To understand better the systemic and cellular responses to long-term energy shortage, we investigated a hemizygous mouse model of MMAuria that has a knock-in (ki) missense allele combined with a knock-out (ko) allele (Mmut-ko/ki) and shows typical clinical features including reduced growth. We found Mmut-ko/ki (mutant) mice, compared to their Mmut-ki/wt (control) littermates, to have a relative increase in fat mass despite their reduced body mass. Although white adipose tissue appears normal, they have a whitening of brown adipose tissue manifesting in lower body surface temperature and lesser ability to cope with cold challenge. Ad libitum fed mice show constitutive hypometabolism: they have reduced food intake, reduced carbohydrate oxidation not offset by lipid oxidation, and have reduced plasma glucose but elevated lactate and Fgf21. Together, these culminate in a loss of metabolic flexibility, whereby mutant mice show lesser ability to regulate energy sources when switching from the fed to fasted state and have delayed glucose clearance in response to exogenous glucose and insulin. Liver investigations find multi-metabolite accumulation and suggest upregulation of Ppar and Fgf21 controlled metabolic pathways, including beta-oxidation, and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, as molecular consequences. Altogether, this study identifies a multi-faceted metabolic response to chronic energy shortage in MMAuria and suggests hypometabolism combined with dysregulated adaptive capability to be underlying features.
